indicate that the information is not available. do not improvise, guess, or
assume.

## Requested Information

Give me a super brief summary of what this repo is about.
{{else if (eq "installation" info) }}
Give me direct installation instructions, nothing else.
{{else if (eq "example" info) }}
Give me a usage example, do not explain.
{{else if (eq "quickstart" info) }}
Give a quick start guide, if available.
{{/if}}

Here is the README:

{{# if branch }}
{{exec "curl" "-LsSf" (concat "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/" repo  "/refs/heads/" branch "/README.md")}}
{{ else }}
{{exec "curl" "-LsSf" (concat "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/" repo  "/refs/heads/main/README.md")}}
