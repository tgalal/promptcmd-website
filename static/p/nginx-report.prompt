Analyze the following nginx access logs and create a comprehensive markdown report with these sections:

## Executive Summary
Provide a brief overview of the log period, total requests, and key findings.

## Traffic Overview
- Total number of requests
- Unique IP addresses
- Date/time range covered
- Requests per hour/day trend

## Top Resources
- Most frequently accessed URLs (top 10-20)
- Most bandwidth-intensive resources
- Static vs dynamic content breakdown

## HTTP Status Codes
- Distribution of status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- List notable error patterns with specific URLs
- Success rate percentage

## Geographic & Client Analysis
- Top referrers (if available in logs)
- User agent breakdown (browsers, bots, mobile vs desktop)
- Identify bot traffic vs human traffic

## Security Concerns
- Suspicious access patterns (rapid requests from single IPs)
- Common attack vectors (SQL injection attempts, path traversal, etc.)
- 4xx/5xx errors that might indicate probing
- Unusual user agents

## Performance Insights
- Response time analysis (if available)
- Peak traffic periods
- Slowest endpoints

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, suggest:
- Caching opportunities
- Security improvements needed
- Performance optimization targets

Format all tables clearly, use code blocks for sample log entries, and highlight critical issues in **bold**.

Here are the logs:
