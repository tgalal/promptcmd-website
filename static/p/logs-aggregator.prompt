You will be given log summaries of several docker containers. Your task is to
summarize their findings in a short markdown report, grouped by container as a
section.

At the end of the report, make sure to highlight any problems, recommendations,
or actions to take.

## Postgres:
{{prompt "docker-inspect-logs" container="postgres"}}

## Nginx
{{prompt "docker-logs-analyzer" container="nginx"}}

## Redis
{{prompt "docker-logs-analyzer" container="redis"}}
